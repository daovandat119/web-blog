              What is Krisp AI?
            </h1>
            <p className="my-5">
              During the past few years, many promising artificial intelligence
              companies emerged to support remote work. Krisp was one of the
              leading AI companies to improve the audio and video calls quality.
              Krisp’s AI-powered noise, voice, and echo cancellation technology
              has been named one of the Time 100 “Best Inventions of 2020” in
              the artificial intelligence category
            </p>
            <p className="my-5">
              Krisp app employs Deep Neural Network (DNN) technology to separate
              human voice from background noise in real-time audio processing.
              They designed this technology using ten thousand hours of human
              voice and background noises to identify and eliminate unwanted
              noise.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5">
              The most common challenge that Krisp aims to solve is to remove
              unwanted background noise for better audio quality. Noise
              cancelling is crucial not solely to remote workers but for
              everyone working in a noisy environment.
            </p>
            While Krisp is mainly recognized as a noise-cancelling app, it also
            has solid features supporting online video conferences. Krisp is the
            only AI note-taking tool not require bots to join remote video and
            audio calls and transcribe meetings.

            </h1>
            <p className="my-5">
              One of Krisp's most powerful features is its ability to cancel

              Krisp excels in background noise suppression by filtering out
