              What is the difference between Otter and Fathom?
            </h1>
            <p class="my-5">
              Otter AI is primarily focused on providing accurate transcription
              services, while Fathom goes beyond transcription to offer
              AI-powered insights, summaries, and CRM integrations. Fathom is
              better suited for business teams looking for deeper analysis and
              workflow integration.

              Is Otter.ai the best transcription service?
            </h1>
            <p class="my-5">
              Otter AI is one of the top transcription services, known for its
              accuracy and ease of use. However, depending on your specific
              needs (e.g., language support, additional features), other
              services like Rev or Trint might also be suitable alternatives.
            </p>

            <h1 id="faq3" class="text-xl work-sans-900 my-5">
              Does Fathom have the best free plan?
            </h1>
            <p class="my-5">
              Fathom offers a free plan with basic transcription and meeting
              insights features. However, its premium plans offer more advanced
              features like CRM integration and AI-powered follow-up actions.
              Whether it has the best free plan depends on your team's needs.

              Is Otter AI or Fathom better for customer success teams?
            </h1>
            <p class="my-5">
              Fathom is generally the better choice for customer success teams
              due to its focus on CRM integrations, actionable insights, and
              AI-powered follow-ups. Otter AI is better suited for teams that
              need accurate transcription and collaboration features.
