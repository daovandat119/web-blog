              Foxit offers a free version that lets you read and view PDFs with
              basic tools. For more advanced features, there are two premium
              plans available.
              <br />
              <br />
              The paid plans include extra features like electronic signatures
              and smart redaction, but come with limitations, such as
              restrictions on AI credits and signing tools.
              <br />
              <br />
              The PDF Editor+ plan costs $172.79 per year, unlocking advanced
              tools. If you want more AI credits, an additional $49.99/year
              gives you 2,000 AI credits per month.

                    Writing notes works similarly to Notion. It uses blocks to
                    structure your content. You can use different paragraph
                    styles, add quotes, callouts, and more. If you click on the
                    "/" tab, you can create blocks. When creating them, you can
                    choose from many formats, from templates, text, tables,
                    images, calendars, and so on.

                    easy for people to get the information they need quickly, as
                    it has advanced visualization features. Coda offers numerous

                    project planning and tracking much smoother. For example, it

                    other views. It is very easy to create customized dashboards

              Nitro has features similar to Adobe Pro, but it is significantly

              with the loading time.
              <br></br>

              It adopted a smooth drag-and-drop function when editing text or
              image formats. It makes it easy to edit or create PDFs quickly.

              Using Nitro’s free version, you can view and read your PDFs and
              utilize its PDF reader tools. Besides the free version, Nitro
              offers two plans.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Essentially, you can have many advanced features with this plan;
              the real limitations of this plan are the limited AI credits and
              signing tools.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Nevertheless, if you need the eSign, smart redact features, and
              want to use Nitro on your mobile, you must go with the PDF
              Editor+. You can get this plan for $172.79 per year and access all
              the advanced features of Nitro.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Lastly, if you want to add AI Assistant, which includes 2000
              credits per month, that is an extra $49.99/year.

              PDFelement has features similar to Adobe Pro, but it is
              significantly cheaper. Another difference I noticed is that
              PDFelement is a fast PDF reader. Even when I opened up large
              files, I did not have an issue with the loading time.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              It adopted a smooth drag-and-drop function when editing text or
              image formats. It makes it easy to edit or create PDFs quickly.

              Using PDFelement’s free version, you can view and read your PDFs
              and utilize its PDF reader tools. Besides the free version,
              PDFelement offers two plans.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Essentially, you can have many advanced features with this plan;
              the real limitations of this plan are the limited AI credits and
              signing tools.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Nevertheless, if you need the eSign, smart redact features, and
              want to use PDFelement on your mobile, you must go with the PDF
              Editor+. You can get this plan for $172.79 per year and access all
              the advanced features of PDFelement.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Lastly, if you want to add AI Assistant, which includes 2000
              credits per month, that is an extra $49.99/year.

                <li>
                  Heavy Software: Adobe Reader can be resource-heavy, leading to
                  slower performance on older computers or devices with low
                  memory.

                <li>
                  Expensive Paid Version: While the free version is limited, the
                  paid versions of Adobe Acrobat can be expensive, especially
                  for users only needing basic features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Limited Free Features: The free version of Adobe Reader
                  doesn’t support advanced editing tools such as converting PDFs
                  or editing text and images.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Occasional Ads: The free version of Adobe Reader may display
                  ads prompting users to upgrade to the paid version, which can
                  be annoying to some users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Privacy Concerns: Adobe Reader requires an internet connection
                  to use certain features, and some users may have privacy
                  concerns regarding their data.
