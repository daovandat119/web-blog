            </h1>
            <h1 className="mt-10">
              Notion has undoubtedly become one of the most popular note-taking
              apps out there and for a good reason. Its flexibility,
              customization options, and all-in-one workspace have made it a
              favorite among many users. People use it for project management,
              task management, note-taking, or creating a knowledge base.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              However, there are many productivity tools out there that also
              offer great value for individuals and businesses.{" "}
              <span className="work-sans-900">
                When putting together my list of best Notion alternatives, I
                considered numerous factors:

                  <span className="font-bold">Note-taking tools:</span> Writing
                  notes works similarly to Notion. It uses blocks to structure
                  your content. You can use different paragraph styles, add
                  quotes, callouts, and more. If you click on the "/" tab, you
                  can create blocks. When creating them, you can choose from
                  many formats, from templates, text, tables, images, calendars,
                  and so on.

                    My goal was to find Notion alternatives for a reasonable
                    price. So, I excluded those alternatives which are
                    significantly more expensive than Notion.

                  answer questions, or help you brainstorm an idea or convert it

            Adobe Acrobat Reader is the go-to tool for viewing and working with
            PDFs. It’s reliable, user-friendly, and fast. The free version
            provides all the basic functionality needed for most users, and the
            premium version offers even more advanced features, making it a
            must-have tool for anyone working with PDFs.

            It’s particularly useful for reading, annotating, and filling out
            forms, and I’ve found it to be incredibly intuitive. The integration
            with Adobe Document Cloud is a big plus, enabling me to access my
            documents from any device.
