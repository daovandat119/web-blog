              Cons of MinutesLink
            </h1>
            <p className="my-5">
              While MinutesLink is powerful, it does have some limitations. The
              free plan is quite basic and may not be sufficient for teams with
              more advanced needs, such as real-time collaborative features or
              deeper integrations.
            </p>
            <p className="my-5">
              Additionally, some users may find the AI summaries occasionally
              miss nuanced details that a human note-taker might capture.
